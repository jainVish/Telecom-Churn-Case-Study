# Telecom Churn Case Study:
> In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. As a data scientist, our task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

## General Info
* As a data scientist, our task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

## Technologies Used
* We are using EDA to do the analysis here using python with pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, plotly, plotly.graph_objs, math.
- library - pandas
- library - matplotlib
- library - python 3.10.4
- library - seaborn
- library - numpy
- library - sklearn
- library - statsmodels
- library - scipy

## Conclusions
* GrLivArea:an increase of 1 square foot of house area above ground, the price will increase by 1.09 to 1.11 times
* OverallQual_9 & OverallQual_8: if the overall material and finish of the house is Very Good or Excellent, the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.13 times
* Neighborhood_Crawfor: if Crawford is a nearby location, then the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.09 times
* Functional_Typ: if the home functionality is typical, then the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.08 times
* Exterior1st_BrkFace: if the exterior covering on the house is Brick Face, the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.08 times.
